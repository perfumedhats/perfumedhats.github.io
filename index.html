<div>Do you ever find yourself reading Victorian period-fiction melodramas
    only to have the suspension of disbelief ruined when Sir Edgan Linton
    implausibly doffs his hat in church during a sermon, only for you to
    angrily close all your AO3 tabs shouting "If only elliot_from_scrubs_87
    had a passing knowledge of hat doffing etiquette, perhaps I could finish
    reading their Malcolm in the Middlemarch cross-over", but in a rare moment
     of humility, you begin wondering if you actually have the hat doffing mastery
      you've always imagined yourself to have in your own AO3 Malcolm Gladwell in the Middle cross-overs?</div>

<div>Do you ever wish the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=rw-FbwmzPKo">Halifax Explosion Heritage Minute</a>
    was a vintage game nearly as long as the heritage minute itself?
    Do you find keyboards with multiple buttons to be hopelessly baroque?
    Are you frustrated by modern triple-A games featuring TOO MANY graphics?
    Then <a href="https://perfumedhats.github.io/pier6/">this game</a> is for you</div>
